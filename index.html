            <p>Understanding Market Relationships Through Data Visualization</p>

        <div class="content">
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Cryptocurrencies move very differently from the stock market, and that becomes even more obvious during big events like COVID, the 2021 run-up, the 2022 to 2023 crash, and situations like the Terra and FTX collapses. While the S&P 500 normally follows steadier and more predictable patterns, coins like Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Litecoin, and BNB can rise or fall at a much faster pace. Sometimes crypto moves in the same direction as the stock market and sometimes it breaks off completely, which raises an important question about how connected these markets actually are.
            </p>
            <p>
                We chose this topic because understanding that connection has become increasingly relevant. All three of us are interested in business and economics, and crypto has become a major part of the financial world as technology continues to grow. The line between traditional finance and digital assets is not as clear as it used to be, and many investors, companies, and policymakers now pay attention to how these markets affect each other. Studying these relationships helps us see whether crypto is becoming more integrated into the broader economy or if it still behaves like its own separate space.
            </p>
            
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h3>Research Goals</h3>
                <p>The goal of this project is to understand when and how the relationships between crypto and the stock market shift. To do that, we focus on three questions:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>How much more volatile are major cryptocurrencies compared to the S&P 500</li>
                    <li>When do crypto and the stock market start moving together or separate</li>
                    <li>Which major events appear to drive the strongest changes in market behavior</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            
            <p>
                Previous studies show that the connection between crypto and equities is not stable. It becomes stronger during periods of stress and weaker during calmer markets. By visualizing these patterns, we can see when crypto behaves like a risky extension of the stock market and when it acts like its own independent ecosystem.
            </p>
            
            <h2>Data Description</h2>
            <p>
                For this project, we collected five years of daily price data for six assets using the yfinance API: SPY, Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), XRP, Litecoin (LTC), and Binance Coin (BNB).
            </p>
            
            <div class="asset-list">
                <div class="asset-item">
                    <strong>SPY:</strong> An index fund that tracks the S&P 500, which represents the overall U.S. stock market.
                </div>
                <div class="asset-item">
                    <strong>BTC (Bitcoin):</strong> The largest cryptocurrency by market cap and often considered the benchmark for the crypto market.
                </div>
                <div class="asset-item">
                    <strong>ETH (Ethereum):</strong> The second largest cryptocurrency, known for smart contracts and decentralized apps.
                </div>
                <div class="asset-item">
                    <strong>XRP:</strong> A digital asset tied to Ripple, often influenced by legal and regulatory developments.
                </div>
                <div class="asset-item">
                    <strong>LTC (Litecoin):</strong> A long-standing cryptocurrency designed for faster and cheaper transactions.
                </div>
                <div class="asset-item">
                    <strong>BNB (Binance Coin):</strong> A coin tied to Binance, one of the world's largest exchanges, and heavily affected by exchange-related news.
                </div>
            </div>
            
            <p>
                The data includes standard financial information such as the daily open and close prices, highest and lowest prices of the day, adjusted close, and trading volume.
            </p>
            <p>
                We organized all six assets into one combined dataset so that each day appears as a separate row with the corresponding ticker. After cleaning the data by removing duplicates, fixing date formats, and dropping rows missing important values, we added a "Drivers" column that lists the key companies or organizations associated with each asset. This gives extra context when interpreting market movements.
            </p>
            <p>
                The final dataset contains more than ten thousand daily observations across all six assets. To support our analysis, we created several new features that help us understand how these assets behave over time. These include:
            </p>
            
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Daily_Return</strong>, which shows how much the closing price changed from the previous day</li>
                <li><strong>Log_Return</strong>, a more stable way to measure returns over long periods</li>
                <li><strong>Rolling_Volatility</strong>, which tells us how "unstable" or "bumpy" each asset has been</li>
                <li><strong>Rolling_Mean</strong>, which smooths out daily noise to highlight general trends</li>
                <li><strong>Rolling_Max</strong>, the highest closing price so far</li>
                <li><strong>Drawdown</strong>, which shows how far a price has fallen from its most recent peak</li>
                <li><strong>Corr_with_SPY</strong>, which tells us how closely each crypto moves with the S&P 500 over time</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Why we used a 30-day window?</h3>
            <p>
                Many of these new features are based on a 30-day rolling window. We chose 30 days because:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>It reflects about one month of trading, which is a realistic amount of time for markets to react to news, policy changes, or major events.</li>
                <li>It smooths out random daily noise, so patterns become easier to see without losing important short-term changes.</li>
                <li>It is commonly used in finance for measuring recent volatility and identifying market trends.</li>
                <li>It captures meaningful shifts in how crypto behaves compared to the stock market. Abrupt changes in a 30-day window often line up with real events, which helps us understand cause and effect.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <p>
                    <strong>Overall, the 30-day window helps us balance detail and clarity.</strong> It is long enough to reveal trends but short enough to show how quickly markets can change.
                </p>
            </div>
            
            <p>
                These features allow us to directly compare volatility, trends, and correlations between cryptocurrencies and the S&P 500, and they form the foundation of all the visualizations in our project.
